        <h1>Welcome to My World</h1>

        <p class="a">
            My life isn't quite like the normal college students. Fist of all I am a bit older than most people here at <abbr title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr>. When I graduated from high school I was accepted into college (<abbr title= "University of Massachusetts">UMASS</abbr> Amherst). Attended it for about a month and found that it was not for me, at least not at the moment. Once I dropped out I started working as an apprentice electrician. Did this for about 6 months before signing up for the Air Force. This is where my life actually started to look up.
        </p>
        <p>
            I left for the Air Force in December 2013. Basic training was eight and half weeks and was not as bad as people think it is. Just listen and do what your told and its fine. I was then based in <a href="https://notaboutthemiles.com/best-things-to-do-in-las-vegas/">Vegas</a> which most think is amazing, it's not. Completed my four years of service, made a few friends but was ready to leave. Started applying to colleges about a month before my seperation date and was lucky enough to get accepted to <abbr title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr> and the Electrical Engineering program. This all happened in November of 2017. Started school that spring.
